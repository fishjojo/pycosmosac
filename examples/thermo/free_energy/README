Hydration free energy calculation workflow:
1. Perform COSMO calculation for both solute and solvent to generate the .cosmo files.
   Parameters in this example were optimized for GEPOL SES surfaces with solvent radius of 1.3 Bohr, BP86 functional and SVP basis set (aug-cc-pvtz was used for H2O).
   The current .cosmo file format follows the settings in https://github.com/qsimulate/qm/tree/cosmo_file. Other format can be customized in pycosmosac/cosmo.
2. Run hydration_energy.py.
